# Radio Astronomy Stations Database Tool

This project is a GUI application for managing a database of radio astronomy stations. This software allows IAU CPS staff to prepare ITU database snapshots and also allows end-users to view the CPS Database output files.

# Installation
This project was only tested with a specific combination of packages, and it is thus recommended that the reference environment be recreated.
The environment should be created via the conda command:
```
conda env create -f environment_ras_db_min.yml
```
This will create RAS_DB environment which will be able to launch the DB_generator_GUI_QT.py file.
Alternatively, a pre-built package is available, but it might not be up to date with the most recent version of the code.
